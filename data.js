If the corporation is to be authorized to issue more than 1 class of stock, the certificate of incorporation shall      set forth the total number of shares of all classes of stock which the corporation shall have authority to issue and the number      of shares of each class and shall specify each class the shares of which are to be without par value and each class the shares      of which are to have par value and the par value of the shares of each such class.

The foregoing provisions of      this paragraph shall not apply to nonstock corporations. In the case of nonstock corporations, the fact that they are not      authorized to issue capital stock shall be stated in the certificate of incorporation. The conditions of membership, or other      criteria for identifying members, of nonstock corporations shall likewise be stated in the certificate of incorporation or      the bylaws. Nonstock corporations shall have members, but failure to have members shall not affect otherwise valid corporate      acts or work a forfeiture or dissolution of the corporation. Nonstock corporations may provide for classes or groups of members      having relative rights, powers and duties, and may make provision for the future creation of additional classes or groups      of members having such relative rights, powers and duties as may from time to time be established, including rights, powers      and duties senior to existing classes and groups of members. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, nonstock corporations      may also provide that any member or class or group of members shall have full, limited, or no voting rights or powers, including      that any member or class or group of members shall have the right to vote on a specified transaction even if that member or      class or group of members does not have the right to vote for the election of the members of the governing body of the corporation.      Voting by members of a nonstock corporation may be on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, group, or any other      basis set forth. The provisions referred to in the 3 preceding sentences may be set forth in the certificate of incorporation      or the bylaws. If neither the certificate of incorporation nor the bylaws of a nonstock corporation state the conditions of      membership, or other criteria for identifying members, the members of the corporation shall be deemed to be those entitled      to vote for the election of the members of the governing body pursuant to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of such      corporation or otherwise until thereafter otherwise provided by the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws;   \n(5) The name and mailing address of the incorporator or incorporators;\n(6) If the powers of the incorporator or incorporators are to terminate upon the filing of the certificate of incorporation,      the names and mailing addresses of the persons who are to serve as directors until the first annual meeting of stockholders      or until their successors are elected and qualify.   \n(b) In addition to the matters required to be set forth in the certificate of incorporation by subsection (a) of this section,      the certificate of incorporation may also contain any or all of the following matters:   \n(1) Any provision for the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the corporation, and any provision      creating, defining, limiting and regulating the powers of the corporation, the directors, and the stockholders, or any class      of the stockholders, or the governing body, members, or any class or group of members of a nonstock corporation; if such provisions      are not contrary to the laws of this State. Any provision which is required or permitted by any section of this chapter to      be stated in the bylaws may instead be stated in the certificate of incorporation;   \n(2) The following provisions,  in haec verba, (i), for a corporation other than a nonstock corporation, viz:\n\"Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between      this corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware      may, on the application in a summary way of this corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application      of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under § 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application      of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under § 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware      Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this corporation,      as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three fourths      in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this corporation,      as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this corporation as consequence of      such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the      court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the      stockholders or class of stockholders, of this corporation, as the case may be, and also on this corporation\"; or   \n(ii), for a nonstock corporation, viz:\n\"Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between      this corporation and its members or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may,      on the application in a summary way of this corporation or of any creditor or member thereof or on the application of any      receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under § 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of      trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under § 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware      Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the members or class of members of this corporation,      as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs.

No stockholder      shall have any preemptive right to subscribe to an additional issue of stock or to any security convertible into such stock      unless, and except to the extent that, such right is expressly granted to such stockholder in the certificate of incorporation.      All such rights in existence on July 3, 1967, shall remain in existence unaffected by this paragraph unless and until changed      or terminated by appropriate action which expressly provides for the change or termination;   \n(4) Provisions requiring for any corporate action, the vote of a larger portion of the stock or of any class or series thereof,      or of any other securities having voting power, or a larger number of the directors, than is required by this chapter;   \n(5) A provision limiting the duration of the corporation's existence to a specified date; otherwise, the corporation shall      have perpetual existence;   \n(6) A provision imposing personal liability for the debts of the corporation on its stockholders to a specified extent and      upon specified conditions; otherwise, the stockholders of a corporation shall not be personally liable for the payment of      the corporation's debts except as they may be liable by reason of their own conduct or acts;   \n(7) A provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary      damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability      of a director: (i) For any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; (ii) for acts      or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) under § 174 of      this title; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. No such provision shall      eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any act or omission occurring prior to the date when such provision becomes      effective. All references in this paragraph to a director shall also be deemed to refer to such other person or persons, if      any, who, pursuant to a provision of the certificate of incorporation in accordance with §  141(a) of this title, exercise      or perform any of the powers or duties otherwise conferred or imposed upon the board of directors by this title.   \n(c) It shall not be necessary to set forth in the certificate of incorporation any of the powers conferred on corporations      by this chapter.   \n(d) Except for provisions included pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(5), (a)(6), (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(7) of this section,      and provisions included pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section specifying the classes, number of shares, and par value      of shares a corporation other than a nonstock corporation is authorized to issue, any provision of the certificate of incorporation      may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside such instrument, provided that the manner in which such facts shall      operate upon the provision is clearly and explicitly set forth therein. The term \"facts,\" as used in this subsection, includes,      but is not limited to, the occurrence of any event, including a determination or action by any person or body, including the      corporation.   \n(e) The exclusive right to the use of a name that is available for use by a domestic or foreign corporation may be reserved      by or on behalf of:   \n(1) Any person intending to incorporate or organize a corporation with that name under this chapter or contemplating such      incorporation or organization;   \n(2) Any domestic corporation or any foreign corporation qualified to do business in the State of Delaware, in either case,      intending to change its name or contemplating such a change;   \n(3) Any foreign corporation intending to qualify to do business in the State of Delaware and adopt that name or contemplating      such qualification and adoption; and   \n(4) Any person intending to organize a foreign corporation and have it qualify to do business in the State of Delaware and      adopt that name or contemplating such organization, qualification and adoption.   \nThe reservation of a specified name may be made by filing with the Secretary of State an application, executed by the applicant,      certifying that the reservation is made by or on behalf of a domestic corporation, foreign corporation or other person described      in paragraphs (e)(1)-(4) of this section above, and specifying the name to be reserved and the name and address of the applicant.      If the Secretary of State finds that the name is available for use by a domestic or foreign corporation, the Secretary shall      reserve the name for the use of the applicant for a period of 120 days. The same applicant may renew for successive 120-day      periods a reservation of a specified name by filing with the Secretary of State, prior to the expiration of such reservation      (or renewal thereof), an application for renewal of such reservation, executed by the applicant, certifying that the reservation      is renewed by or on behalf of a domestic corporation, foreign corporation or other person described in paragraphs (e)(1)-(4)      of this section above and specifying the name reservation to be renewed and the name and address of the applicant. The right      to the exclusive use of a reserved name may be transferred to any other person by filing in the office of the Secretary of      State a notice of the transfer, executed by the applicant for whom the name was reserved, specifying the name reservation      to be transferred and the name and address of the transferee. The reservation of a specified name may be cancelled by filing      with the Secretary of State a notice of cancellation, executed by the applicant or transferee, specifying the name reservation      to be cancelled and the name and address of the applicant or transferee. Unless the Secretary of State finds that any application,      application for renewal, notice of transfer, or notice of cancellation filed with the Secretary of State as required by this      subsection does not conform to law, upon receipt of all filing fees required by law the Secretary of State shall prepare and      return to the person who filed such instrument a copy of the filed instrument with a notation thereon of the action taken      by the Secretary of State. A fee as set forth in § 391 of this title shall be paid at the time of the reservation of any name,      at the time of the renewal of any such reservation and at the time of the filing of a notice of the transfer or cancellation      of any such reservation.

If any incorporator      is not available by reason of death, incapacity, unknown address, or refusal or neglect to act, then any such other instrument      may be signed, with the same effect as if such incorporator had signed it, by any person for whom or on whose behalf such      incorporator, in executing the certificate of incorporation, was acting directly or indirectly as employee or agent, provided      that such other instrument shall state that such incorporator is not available and the reason therefor, that such incorporator      in executing the certificate of incorporation was acting directly or indirectly as employee or agent for or on behalf of such      person, and that such person's signature on such instrument is otherwise authorized and not wrongful.   \n(2) All other instruments shall be signed:\na. By any authorized officer of the corporation; or\nb. If it shall appear from the instrument that there are no such officers, then by a majority of the directors or by such      directors as may be designated by the board; or   \nc. If it shall appear from the instrument that there are no such officers or directors, then by the holders of record, or      such of them as may be designated by the holders of record, of a majority of all outstanding shares of stock; or   \nd. By the holders of record of all outstanding shares of stock.\n(b) Whenever this chapter requires any instrument to be acknowledged, such requirement is satisfied by either:\n(1) The formal acknowledgment by the person or 1 of the persons signing the instrument that it is such person's act and deed      or the act and deed of the corporation, and that the facts stated therein are true. Such acknowledgment shall be made before      a person who is authorized by the law of the place of execution to take acknowledgments of deeds. If such person has a seal      of office such person shall affix it to the instrument.   \n(2) The signature, without more, of the person or persons signing the instrument, in which case such signature or signatures      shall constitute the affirmation or acknowledgment of the signatory, under penalties of perjury, that the instrument is such      person's act and deed or the act and deed of the corporation, and that the facts stated therein are true.   \n(c) Whenever any instrument is to be filed with the Secretary of State or in accordance with this section or chapter, such      requirement means that:   \n(1) The signed instrument shall be delivered to the office of the Secretary of State;\n(2) All taxes and fees authorized by law to be collected by the Secretary of State in connection with the filing of the instrument      shall be tendered to the Secretary of State; and   \n(3) Upon delivery of the instrument, the Secretary of State shall record the date and time of its delivery. Upon such delivery      and tender of the required taxes and fees, the Secretary of State shall certify that the instrument has been filed in the      Secretary of State's office by endorsing upon the signed instrument the word \"Filed\", and the date and time of its filing.      This endorsement is the \"filing date\" of the instrument, and is conclusive of the date and time of its filing in the absence      of actual fraud. The Secretary of State shall file and index the endorsed instrument. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)      of this section and in subsection (i) of this section, such filing date of an instrument shall be the date and time of delivery      of the instrument.   \n(4) Upon request made upon or prior to delivery, the Secretary of State may, to the extent deemed practicable, establish as      the filing date of an instrument a date and time after its delivery. If the Secretary of State refuses to file any instrument      due to an error, omission or other imperfection, the Secretary of State may hold such instrument in suspension, and in such      event, upon delivery of a replacement instrument in proper form for filing and tender of the required taxes and fees within      5 business days after notice of such suspension is given to the filer, the Secretary of State shall establish as the filing      date of such instrument the date and time that would have been the filing date of the rejected instrument had it been accepted      for filing. The Secretary of State shall not issue a certificate of good standing with respect to any corporation with an      instrument held in suspension pursuant to this subsection. The Secretary of State may establish as the filing date of an instrument      the date and time at which information from such instrument is entered pursuant to paragraph (c)(8) of this section if such      instrument is delivered on the same date and within 4 hours after such information is entered.   \n(5) The Secretary of State, acting as agent for the recorders of each of the counties, shall collect and deposit in a separate      account established exclusively for that purpose a county assessment fee with respect to each filed instrument and shall thereafter      weekly remit from such account to the recorder of each of the said counties the amount or amounts of such fees as provided      for in paragraph (c)(6) of this section or as elsewhere provided by law. Said fees shall be for the purposes of defraying      certain costs incurred by the counties in merging the information and images of such filed documents with the document information      systems of each of the recorder's offices in the counties and in retrieving, maintaining and displaying such information and      images in the offices of the recorders and at remote locations in each of such counties. In consideration for its acting as      the agent for the recorders with respect to the collection and payment of the county assessment fees, the Secretary of State      shall retain and pay over to the General Fund of the State an administrative charge of 1 percent of the total fees collected.   \n(6) The assessment fee to the counties shall be $24 for each 1-page instrument filed with the Secretary of State in accordance      with this section and $9.00 for each additional page for instruments with more than 1 page. The recorder's office to receive      the assessment fee shall be the recorder's office in the county in which the corporation's registered office in this State      is, or is to be, located, except that an assessment fee shall not be charged for either a certificate of dissolution qualifying      for treatment under § 391(a)(5)b. of this title or a document filed in accordance with subchapter XV of this chapter.   \n(7) The Secretary of State, acting as agent, shall collect and deposit in a separate account established exclusively for that      purpose a courthouse municipality fee with respect to each filed instrument and shall thereafter monthly remit funds from      such account to the treasuries of the municipalities designated in § 301 of Title 10. Said fees shall be for the purposes      of defraying certain costs incurred by such municipalities in hosting the primary locations for the Delaware courts. The fee      to such municipalities shall be $20 for each instrument filed with the Secretary of State in accordance with this section.      The municipality to receive the fee shall be the municipality designated in § 301 of Title 10 in the county in which the corporation's      registered office in this State is, or is to be, located, except that a fee shall not be charged for a certificate of dissolution      qualifying for treatment under § 391(a)(5)b. of this title, a resignation of agent without appointment of a successor under      § 136 of this title, or a document filed in accordance with subchapter XV of this chapter.   \n(8) The Secretary of State shall cause to be entered such information from each instrument as the Secretary of State deems      appropriate into the Delaware Corporation Information System or any system which is a successor thereto in the office of the      Secretary of State, and such information and a copy of each such instrument shall be permanently maintained as a public record      on a suitable medium. The Secretary of State is authorized to grant direct access to such system to registered agents subject      to the execution of an operating agreement between the Secretary of State and such registered agent. Any registered agent      granted such access shall demonstrate the existence of policies to ensure that information entered into the system accurately      reflects the content of instruments in the possession of the registered agent at the time of entry.   \n(d) Any instrument filed in accordance with subsection (c) of this section shall be effective upon its filing date. Any instrument      may provide that it is not to become effective until a specified time subsequent to the time it is filed, but such time shall      not be later than a time on the ninetieth day after the date of its filing. If any instrument filed in accordance with subsection      (c) of this section provides for a future effective date or time and if the transaction is terminated or its terms are amended      to change the future effective date or time prior to the future effective date or time, the instrument shall be terminated      or amended by the filing, prior to the future effective date or time set forth in such instrument, of a certificate of termination      or amendment of the original instrument, executed in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, which shall identify      the instrument which has been terminated or amended and shall state that the instrument has been terminated or the manner      in which it has been amended.   \n(e) If another section of this chapter specifically prescribes a manner of executing, acknowledging or filing a specified      instrument or a time when such instrument shall become effective which differs from the corresponding provisions of this section,      then such other section shall govern.   \n(f) Whenever any instrument authorized to be filed with the Secretary of State under any provision of this title, has been      so filed and is an inaccurate record of the corporate action therein referred to, or was defectively or erroneously executed,      sealed or acknowledged, the instrument may be corrected by filing with the Secretary of State a certificate of correction      of the instrument which shall be executed, acknowledged and  filed in accordance with this section. The certificate of correction      shall specify the inaccuracy or defect to be corrected and shall set forth the portion of the instrument in corrected form.      In lieu of filing a certificate of correction the instrument may be corrected by filing with the Secretary of State a corrected      instrument which shall be executed, acknowledged and filed in accordance with this section.  The corrected instrument shall      be specifically designated as such in its heading, shall specify the inaccuracy or defect to be corrected, and shall set forth      the entire instrument in corrected form.  An instrument corrected in accordance with this section shall be effective as of      the date the original instrument was filed, except as to those persons who are substantially and adversely affected by the      correction and as to those persons the instrument as corrected shall be effective from the filing date.   \n(g) Notwithstanding that any instrument authorized to be filed with the Secretary of State under this title is when filed      inaccurately, defectively or erroneously executed, sealed or acknowledged, or otherwise defective in any respect, the Secretary      of State shall have no liability to any person for the preclearance for filing, the acceptance for filing or the filing and      indexing of such instrument by the Secretary of State.   \n(h) Any signature on any instrument authorized to be filed with the Secretary of State under this title may be a facsimile,      a conformed signature or an electronically transmitted signature.   \n(i)(1) If:\na. Together with the actual delivery of an instrument and tender of the required taxes and fees, there is delivered to the      Secretary of State a separate affidavit (which in its heading shall be designated as an \"affidavit of extraordinary condition\")      attesting, on the basis of personal knowledge of the affiant or a reliable source of knowledge identified in the affidavit,      that an earlier effort to deliver such instrument and tender such taxes and fees was made in good faith, specifying the nature,      date and time of such good faith effort and requesting that the Secretary of State establish such date and time as the filing      date of such instrument; or   \nb. Upon the actual delivery of an instrument and tender of the required taxes and fees, the Secretary of State in the Secretary's      discretion provides a written waiver of the requirement for such an affidavit stating that it appears to the Secretary of      State that an earlier effort to deliver such instrument and tender such taxes and fees was made in good faith and specifying      the date and time of such effort; and   \nc. The Secretary of State determines that an extraordinary condition existed at such date and time, that such earlier effort      was unsuccessful as a result of the existence of such extraordinary condition, and that such actual delivery and tender were      made within a reasonable period (not to exceed 2 business days) after the cessation of such extraordinary condition,   \nthen the Secretary of State may establish such date and time as the filing date of such instrument. No fee shall be paid to      the Secretary of State for receiving an affidavit of extraordinary condition.   \n(2) For purposes of this subsection, an \"extraordinary condition\" means: any emergency resulting from an attack on, invasion      or occupation by foreign military forces of, or disaster, catastrophe, war or other armed conflict, revolution or insurrection,      or rioting or civil commotion in, the United States or a locality in which the Secretary of State conducts its business or      in which the good faith effort to deliver the instrument and tender the required taxes and fees is made, or the immediate      threat of any of the foregoing; or any malfunction or outage of the electrical or telephone service to the Secretary of State's      office, or weather or other condition in or about a locality in which the Secretary of State conducts its business, as a result      of which the Secretary of State's office is not open for the purpose of the filing of instruments under this chapter or such      filing cannot be effected without extraordinary effort. The Secretary of State may require such proof as it deems necessary      to make the determination required under paragraph (i)(1)c. of this section, and any such determination shall be conclusive      in the absence of actual fraud.   \n(3) If the Secretary of State establishes the filing date of an instrument pursuant to this subsection, the date and time      of delivery of the affidavit of extraordinary condition or the date and time of the Secretary of State's written waiver of      such affidavit shall be endorsed on such affidavit or waiver and such affidavit or waiver, so endorsed, shall be attached      to the filed instrument to which it relates. Such filed instrument shall be effective as of the date and time established      as the filing date by the Secretary of State pursuant to this subsection, except as to those persons who are substantially      and adversely affected by such establishment and, as to those persons, the instrument shall be effective from the date and      time endorsed on the affidavit of extraordinary condition or written waiver attached thereto.

One such dean      on this panel shall be nominated by the trustees of said law school corporation; another dean shall be nominated by a committee      of the Student Bar Association of said law school; and the other dean shall be nominated by a committee of lawyers who are      parents of students attending such law school. If any of the above-named groups cannot find a dean, it may substitute 2 full      professors of accredited law schools for the dean it is entitled to nominate, and in such a case if the Attorney General chooses      1 of such professors, such professor shall serve the function of a dean as herein prescribed. If the dean so retained shall      report in writing that, in such dean's professional judgment, the corporation is attempting, in good faith, to comply with      the standards for approval of the American Bar Association and is making reasonable progress toward meeting such standards,      the corporation may file a copy of the report with the Secretary of Education and with the Attorney General. Any corporation      which complies with these provisions by filing such report shall be deemed to have temporary approval from the State and shall      be entitled to amend its certificate of incorporation to authorize the granting of standard academic law degrees. Thereafter,      until the law school operated by the corporation is approved by the American Bar Association, the corporation shall file once      during each academic year a new report, in the same manner as the first report. If, at any time, the corporation fails to      file such a report, or if the dean retained to render such report states that, in such dean's opinion, the corporation is      not continuing to make reasonable progress toward accreditation, the Attorney General, at the request of the Secretary of      Education, may file a complaint in the Court of Chancery to suspend said temporary approval and degree-granting power until      a further report is filed by a dean or dean emeritus of an accredited law school that the school has resumed its progress      towards meeting the standards for approval. Upon approval of the law school by the American Bar Association, temporary approval      shall become final, and shall no longer be subject to suspension or vacation under this section.

(5) as a result of the merger the constituent corporation or its successor becomes or remains a direct or indirect      wholly-owned subsidiary of the holding company; (6) the directors of the constituent corporation become or remain the directors      of the holding company upon the effective time of the merger;

provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (i)(A), any surviving entity that is not a corporation shall include      in such amendment a requirement that the approval of the stockholders of the holding company be obtained for any act or transaction      by or involving the surviving entity, other than the election or removal of directors or managers, managing members or other      members of the governing body of the surviving entity, which would require the approval of the stockholders of the surviving      entity if the surviving entity were a corporation subject to this chapter; (B) any amendment of the organizational documents      of a surviving entity that is not a corporation, which amendment would, if adopted by a corporation subject to this chapter,      be required to be included in the certificate of incorporation of such corporation, shall, by specific reference to this subsection,      require, in addition, the approval of the stockholders of the holding company (or any successor by merger), by the same vote      as is required by this chapter and/or by the organizational documents of the surviving entity; and (C) the business and affairs      of a surviving entity that is not a corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, board      of managers or other governing body consisting of individuals who are subject to the same fiduciary duties applicable to,      and who are liable for breach of such duties to the same extent as, directors of a corporation subject to this chapter; and      (ii) the organizational documents of the surviving entity may be amended in the merger (A) to reduce the number of classes      and shares of capital stock or other equity interests or units that the surviving entity is authorized to issue and (B) to      eliminate any provision authorized by § 141(d) of this title; and (8) the stockholders of the constituent corporation do not      recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as determined by the board of directors of the constituent      corporation. Neither paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section nor any provision of a surviving entity's organizational documents      required by paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section shall be deemed or construed to require approval of the stockholders of the      holding company to elect or remove directors or managers, managing members or other members of the governing body of the surviving      entity.

From and after the effective time of a merger adopted by a constituent      corporation by action of its board of directors and without any vote of stockholders pursuant to this subsection: (i) to the      extent the restrictions of § 203 of this title applied to the constituent corporation and its stockholders at the effective      time of the merger, such restrictions shall apply to the holding company and its stockholders immediately after the effective      time of the merger as though it were the constituent corporation, and all shares of stock of the holding company acquired      in the merger shall for purposes of § 203 of this title be deemed to have been acquired at the time that the shares of stock      of the constituent corporation converted in the merger were acquired, and provided further that any stockholder who immediately      prior to the effective time of the merger was not an interested stockholder within the meaning of § 203 of this title shall      not solely by reason of the merger become an interested stockholder of the holding company, (ii) if the corporate name of      the holding company immediately following the effective time of the merger is the same as the corporate name of the constituent      corporation immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, the shares of capital stock of the holding company into      which the shares of capital stock of the constituent corporation are converted in the merger shall be represented by the stock      certificates that previously represented shares of capital stock of the constituent corporation and (iii) to the extent a      stockholder of the constituent corporation immediately prior to the merger had standing to institute or maintain derivative      litigation on behalf of the constituent corporation, nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit or extinguish such standing.      If an agreement of merger is adopted by a constituent corporation by action of its board of directors and without any vote      of stockholders pursuant to this subsection, the secretary or assistant secretary of the constituent corporation shall certify      on the agreement that the agreement has been adopted pursuant to this subsection and that the conditions specified in the      first sentence of this subsection have been satisfied, provided that such certification on the agreement shall not be required      if a certificate of merger or consolidation is filed in lieu of filing the agreement. The agreement so adopted and certified      shall then be filed and become effective, in accordance with § 103 of this title. Such filing shall constitute a representation      by the person who executes the agreement that the facts stated in the certificate remain true immediately prior to such filing.

Process may be served upon the Secretary of State under this subsection      by means of electronic transmission but only as prescribed by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is authorized      to issue such rules and regulations with respect to such service as the Secretary of State deems necessary or appropriate.      In the event of such service upon the Secretary of State in accordance with this subsection, the Secretary of State shall      forthwith notify such surviving or resulting corporation thereof by letter, directed to such corporation at its address so      specified, unless such surviving or resulting corporation shall have designated in writing to the Secretary of State a different      address for such purpose, in which case it shall be mailed to the last address so designated. Such letter shall be sent by      a mail or courier service that includes a record of mailing or deposit with the courier and a record of delivery evidenced      by the signature of the recipient. Such letter shall enclose a copy of the process and any other papers served upon the Secretary      of State. It shall be the duty of the plaintiff in the event of such service to serve process and any other papers in duplicate,      to notify the Secretary of State that service is being made pursuant to this subsection, and to pay the Secretary of State      the sum of $50 for the use of the State, which sum shall be taxed as a part of the costs in the proceeding if the plaintiff      shall prevail therein. The Secretary of State shall maintain an alphabetical record of any such service setting forth the      name of the plaintiff and defendant, the title, docket number and nature of the proceeding in which process has been served      upon the Secretary of State, the fact that service has been effected pursuant to this subsection, the return date thereof,      and the day and hour when the service was made. The Secretary of State shall not be required to retain such information for      a period longer than 5 years from receipt of the service of process.   \n(e) Section § 251(e) of this title shall apply to a merger under this section if the corporation surviving the merger is a      corporation of this State.   \n(f) Section 251(d) of this title shall apply to a merger under this section; provided, however, that references to the board      of directors, to stockholders, and to shares of a constituent corporation shall be deemed to be references to the governing      body of the corporation, to members of the corporation, and to memberships or membership interests, as applicable, respectively.   \n(g) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize the merger of a charitable nonstock corporation into a nonstock corporation,      if the charitable status of such charitable nonstock corporation would thereby be lost or impaired; but a nonstock corporation      may be merged into a charitable nonstock corporation which shall continue as the surviving corporation.

Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver      to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's      shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that      the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or      consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written      demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting      corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not      voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective;      or   \n(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent      corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days      thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled      to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all      shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section      and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and,      if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective      date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing      of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such      demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder      intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective      date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective      date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation      that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting      corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided,      however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice      need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's      shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of      the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be      prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either      notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date      the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,      the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date,      the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.   \n(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any      stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal      rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the      value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective      date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding      as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered      upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder      who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled      to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate      number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been      received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within      10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation      or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section      hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares      of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file      a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.   \n(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting      corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition      was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their      shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation.      If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly      verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the      hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders      shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week      before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such      publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court,      and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.   \n(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who      have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their      shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for      notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction,      the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.   \n(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance      with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding      the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or      expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the      fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its      discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment      of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any      surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment      of the judgment. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate      in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination      of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting      corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the      Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such      stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.   \n(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or      resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case      of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender      to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the      Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any      state.   \n(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in      the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any      stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the      fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.   \n(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as      provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends      or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which      is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall      be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving      or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger      or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection      (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal      shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any      stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just;      provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding      or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered      upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection      (e) of this section.   \n(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been      converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the      surviving or resulting corporation.

When any conversion shall have become effective under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the State of Delaware,      all of the rights, privileges and powers of the corporation that has converted, and all property, real, personal and mixed,      and all debts due to such corporation, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to such corporation, shall      remain vested in the other entity or business form to which such corporation has converted and shall be the property of such      other entity or business form, and the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise in such corporation shall not      revert or be in any way impaired by reason of this chapter; but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of      such corporation shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the corporation that has converted      shall remain attached to the other entity or business form to which such corporation has converted, and may be enforced against      it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had originally been incurred or contracted by it in its capacity      as such other entity or business form. The rights, privileges, powers and interest in property of the corporation that has      converted, as well as the debts, liabilities and duties of such corporation, shall not be deemed, as a consequence of the      conversion, to have been transferred to the other entity or business form to which such corporation has converted for any      purpose of the laws of the State of Delaware.   \n(i) No vote of stockholders of a corporation shall be necessary to authorize a conversion if no shares of the stock of such      corporation shall have been issued prior to the adoption by the board of directors of the resolution approving the conversion.   \n(j) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize the conversion of a charitable nonstock corporation into another      entity, if the charitable status of such charitable nonstock corporation would thereby be lost or impaired.

The reasonable fees and expenses of such guardian, including all reasonable expert witness      fees, shall be paid by the petitioner in such proceeding.   \n(d) The giving of any notice or making of any offer pursuant to this section shall not revive any claim then barred or constitute      acknowledgment by the corporation or successor entity that any person to whom such notice is sent is a proper claimant and      shall not operate as a waiver of any defense or counterclaim in respect of any claim asserted by any person to whom such notice      is sent.   \n(e) As used in this section, the term \"successor entity\" shall include any trust, receivership or other legal entity governed      by the laws of this State to which the remaining assets and liabilities of a dissolved corporation are transferred and which      exists solely for the purposes of prosecuting and defending suits, by or against the dissolved corporation, enabling the dissolved      corporation to settle and close the business of the dissolved corporation, to dispose of and convey the property of the dissolved      corporation, to discharge the liabilities of the dissolved corporation and to distribute to the dissolved corporation's stockholders      any remaining assets, but not for the purpose of continuing the business for which the dissolved corporation was organized.   \n(f) The time periods and notice requirements of this section shall, in the case of a corporation or successor entity for which      a receiver or trustee has been appointed by the Court of Chancery, be subject to variation by, or in the manner provided in,      the Rules of the Court of Chancery.   \n(g) In the case of a nonstock corporation, any notice referred to in the last sentence of paragraph (a)(3) of this section      shall include a copy of § 114 of this title. In the case of a nonprofit nonstock corporation, provisions of this section regarding      distributions to members shall not apply to the extent that those provisions conflict with any other applicable law or with      that corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

Such reinstatement shall validate all contracts, acts, matters and things made, done and      performed within the scope of its certificate of incorporation by the corporation, its officers and agents during the time      when its certificate of incorporation was forfeited or void pursuant to this title, or after its expiration by limitation,      with the same force and effect and to all intents and purposes as if the certificate of incorporation had at all times remained      in full force and effect. All real and personal property, rights and credits, which belonged to the corporation at the time      its certificate of incorporation became forfeited or void pursuant to this title, or expired by limitation and which were      not disposed of prior to the time of its revival or renewal shall be vested in the corporation, after its revival and renewal,      as fully and amply as they were held by the corporation at and before the time its certificate of incorporation became forfeited      or void pursuant to this title, or expired by limitation, and the corporation after its renewal and revival shall be as exclusively      liable for all contracts, acts, matters and things made, done or performed in its name and on its behalf by its officers and      agents prior to its reinstatement, as if its certificate of incorporation had at all times remained in full force and effect.   \n(f) If, since the certificate of incorporation became forfeited or void pursuant to this title, or expired by limitation,      any other corporation organized under the laws of this State shall have adopted the same name as the corporation sought to      be renewed or revived or shall have adopted a name so nearly similar thereto as not to distinguish it from the corporation      to be renewed or revived or any foreign corporation qualified in accordance with § 371 of this title shall have adopted the      same name as the corporation sought to be renewed or revived or shall have adopted a name so nearly similar thereto as not      to distinguish it from the corporation to be renewed or revived, then in such case the corporation to be renewed or revived      shall not be renewed under the same name which it bore when its certificate of incorporation became forfeited or void pursuant      to this title, or expired but shall adopt or be renewed under some other name and in such case the certificate to be filed      under the provisions of this section shall set forth the name borne by the corporation at the time its certificate of incorporation      became forfeited or void pursuant to this title, or expired and the new name under which the corporation is to be renewed      or revived.   \n(g) Any corporation that renews or revives its certificate of incorporation under this chapter shall pay to this State a sum      equal to all franchise taxes, penalties and interest thereon due at the time its certificate of incorporation became forfeited      or void pursuant to this title, or expired by limitation or otherwise; provided, however, that any corporation that renews      or revives its certificate of incorporation under this chapter whose certificate of incorporation has been forfeited, void      or expired for more than 5 years shall, in lieu of the payment of the franchise taxes and penalties otherwise required by      this subsection, pay a sum equal to 3 times the amount of the annual franchise tax that would be due and payable by such corporation      for the year in which the renewal or revival is effected, computed at the then current rate of taxation. No payment made pursuant      to this subsection shall reduce the amount of franchise tax due under Chapter 5 of this title for the year in which the renewal      or revival is effected.   \n(h) If a sufficient number of the last acting officers of any corporation desiring to renew or revive its certificate of incorporation      are not available by reason of death, unknown address or refusal or neglect to act, the directors of the corporation or those      remaining on the board, even if only 1, may elect successors to such officers. In any case where there shall be no directors      of the corporation available for the purposes aforesaid, the stockholders may elect a full board of directors, as provided      by the bylaws of the corporation, and the board shall then elect such officers as are provided by law, by the certificate      of incorporation or by the bylaws to carry on the business and affairs of the corporation. A special meeting of the stockholders      for the purposes of electing directors may be called by any officer, director or stockholder upon notice given in accordance      with § 222 of this title.   \n(i) After a renewal or revival of the certificate of incorporation of the corporation shall have been effected, the provisions      of § 211(c) of this title shall govern and the period of time the certificate of incorporation of the corporation was forfeited      pursuant to this title, or after its expiration by limitation, shall be included within the calculation of the 30-day and      13-month periods to which § 211(c) of this title refers. A special meeting of stockholders held in accordance with subsection      (h) of this section shall be deemed an annual meeting of stockholders for purposes of § 211(c) of this title.   \n(j) Except as otherwise provided in § 313 of this title, whenever it shall be desired to renew or revive the certificate of      incorporation of any nonstock corporation, the governing body shall perform all the acts necessary for the renewal or revival      of the charter of the corporation which are performed by the board of directors in the case of a corporation having capital      stock, and the members of any nonstock corporation who are entitled to vote for the election of members of its governing body      and any other members entitled to vote for dissolution under the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of such corporation,      shall perform all the acts necessary for the renewal or revival of the certificate of incorporation of the corporation which      are performed by the stockholders in the case of a corporation having capital stock. Except as otherwise provided in § 313      of this title, in all other respects, the procedure for the renewal or revival of the certificate of incorporation of nonstock      corporation shall conform, as nearly as may be applicable, to the procedure prescribed in this section for the renewal or      revival of the certificate of incorporation of a corporation having capital stock; provided, however, that subsection (i)      of this section shall not apply to nonstock corporations.

An undertaking that any transfer of domicile into this State will take place only in the event of an emergency condition      in the jurisdiction the law of which governs the internal affairs of the non-United States entity and that such transfer shall      continue only so long as such emergency condition, in the judgment of the non-United States entity's management, so requires;      and   \n(5) The examination fee prescribed under § 391 of this title.\nIf any of the documents referred to in paragraphs (c)(1)-(5) of this section are not in English, a translation thereof, under      oath of the translator, shall be attached thereto. If such documents satisfy the requirements of this section, and if the      name of the non-United States entity meets the requirements of § 102(a)(1) of this title, the Secretary of State shall notify      the non-United States entity that such documents have been accepted for filing, and the records of the Secretary of State      shall reflect such acceptance and such notification. In addition, the Secretary of State shall enter the name of the non-United      States entity on the Secretary of State's reserved list to remain there so long as the non-United States entity is in compliance      with this section. No document submitted under this subsection shall be available for public inspection pursuant to Chapter      100 of Title 29 until, and unless, such entity effects a transfer of its domicile as provided in this section. The Secretary      of State may waive the 30-day period and translation requirement provided for in this subsection upon request by such entity,      supported by facts (including, without limitation, the existence of an emergency condition) justifying such waiver.   \n(d) On or before March 1 in each year, prior to the transfer of its domicile as provided for in subsection (e) of this section,      during any such transfer and, in the event that it desires to continue to be subject to a transfer of domicile under this      section, after its domicile has ceased to be in this State, the non-United States entity shall file a certificate executed      by an appropriate officer or director of the non-United States entity, certifying that the documents submitted pursuant to      this section remain in full force and effect or attaching any amendments or supplements thereto and translated as required      in subsection (c) of this section, together with the filing fee prescribed under § 391 of this title. In the event that any      non-United States entity fails to file the required certificate on or before March 1 in each year, all certificates and filings      made pursuant to this section shall become null and void on March 2 in such year, and any proposed transfer thereafter shall      be subject to all of the required submissions and the examination fee set forth in subsection (c) of this section.   \n(e) If the Secretary of State accepts the documents submitted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section for filing, such      entity may transfer its domicile to this State at any time by means of a written communication to such effect addressed to      the Secretary of State, signed by 1 of the persons named on the list filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)d. of this section,      and confirming that the statements made pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section remain true and correct; provided, that      if emergency conditions have affected ordinary means of communication, such notification may be made by telegram, telex, telecopy      or other form of writing so long as a duly signed duplicate is received by the Secretary of State within 30 days thereafter.      The records of the Secretary of State shall reflect the fact of such transfer. Upon the payment to the Secretary of State      of the fee prescribed under § 391 of this title, the Secretary of State shall certify that the non-United States entity has      filed all documents and paid all fees required by this title. Such certificate of the Secretary of State shall be prima facie      evidence of transfer by such non-United States entity of its domicile into this State.   \n(f) Except to the extent expressly prohibited by the laws of this State, from and after the time that a non-United States      entity transfers its domicile to this State pursuant to this section, the non-United States entity shall have all of the powers      which it had immediately prior to such transfer under the law of the jurisdiction governing its internal affairs and the directors      and officers designated pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and their successors, may manage the business and affairs      of the non-United States entity in accordance with the laws of such jurisdiction. Any such activity conducted pursuant to      this section shall not be deemed to be doing business within this State for purposes of § 371 of this title. Any reference      in this section to the law of the jurisdiction governing the internal affairs of a non-United States entity which has transferred      its domicile into this State shall be deemed to be a reference to such law as in effect immediately prior to the transfer      of domicile.   \n(g) For purposes of any action in the courts of this State, no non-United States entity which has obtained the certificate      of the Secretary of State referred to in subsection (e) of this section shall be deemed to be an \"enemy\" person or entity      for any purpose, including, without limitation, in relation to any claim of title to its assets, wherever located, or to its      ability to institute suit in said courts.   \n(h) The transfer by any non-United States entity of its domicile into this State shall not be deemed to affect any obligations      or liabilities of such non-United States entity incurred prior to such transfer.   \n(i) The directors of any non-United States entity which has transferred its domicile into this State may withhold from any      holder of equity interests in such entity any amounts payable to such holder on account of dividends or other distributions,      if the directors shall determine that such holder will not have the full benefit of such payment, so long as the directors      shall make provision for the retention of such withheld payment in escrow or under some similar arrangement for the benefit      of such holder.   \n(j) All process issued out of any court of this State, all orders made by any court of this State and all rules and notices      of any kind required to be served on any non-United States entity which has transferred its domicile into this State may be      served on the non-United States entity pursuant to § 321 of this title in the same manner as if such entity were a corporation      of this State. The directors of a non-United States entity which has transferred its domicile into this State shall agree      in writing that they will be amenable to service of process by the same means as, and subject to the jurisdiction of the courts      of this State to the same extent as are directors of corporations of this State, and such agreements shall be submitted to      the Secretary of State for filing before the respective directors take office.   \n(k) Any non-United States entity which has transferred its domicile into this State may voluntarily return to the jurisdiction      the law of which governs its internal affairs by filing with the Secretary of State an application to withdraw from this State.      Such application shall be accompanied by a resolution of the directors of the non-United States entity authorizing such withdrawal      and by a certificate of the highest diplomatic or consular official of such jurisdiction accredited to the United States indicating      the consent of such jurisdiction to such withdrawal. The application shall also contain, or be accompanied by, the agreement      of the non-United States entity that it may be served with process in this State in any proceeding for enforcement of any      obligation of the non-United States entity arising prior to its withdrawal from this State, which agreement shall include      the appointment of the Secretary of State as the agent of the non-United States entity to accept service of process in any      such proceeding and shall specify the address to which a copy of process served upon the Secretary of State shall be mailed.      Upon the payment of any fees and taxes owed to this State, the Secretary of State shall file the application and the non-United      States entity's domicile shall, as of the time of filing, cease to be in this State.

As used in this section, the term:   \n(1) \"Foreign jurisdiction\" means any foreign country, or other foreign jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state,      the District of Columbia, or any possession or territory of the United States); and   \n(2) \"Resulting entity\" means the entity formed, incorporated, created or otherwise coming into being as a consequence of the      transfer of the corporation to, or its domestication or continuance in, a foreign jurisdiction pursuant to this section.   \n(b) The board of directors of the corporation which desires to transfer to or domesticate or continue in a foreign jurisdiction      shall adopt a resolution approving such transfer, domestication or continuance specifying the foreign jurisdiction to which      the corporation shall be transferred or in which the corporation shall be domesticated or continued and, if applicable, that      in connection with such transfer, domestication or continuance the corporation's existence as a corporation of this State      is to continue and recommending the approval of such transfer or domestication or continuance by the stockholders of the corporation.      Such resolution shall be submitted to the stockholders of the corporation at an annual or special meeting. Due notice of the      time, place and purpose of the meeting shall be mailed to each holder of stock, whether voting or nonvoting, of the corporation      at the address of the stockholder as it appears on the records of the corporation, at least 20 days prior to the date of the      meeting. At the meeting, the resolution shall be considered and a vote taken for its adoption or rejection. If all outstanding      shares of stock of the corporation, whether voting or nonvoting, shall be voted for the adoption of the resolution, the corporation      shall file with the Secretary of State a certificate of transfer if its existence as a corporation of this State is to cease      or a certificate of transfer and domestic continuance if its existence as a corporation of this State is to continue, executed      in accordance with § 103 of this title, which certifies:   \n(1) The name of the corporation, and if it has been changed, the name under which it was originally incorporated.\n(2) The date of filing of its original certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State.\n(3) The foreign jurisdiction to which the corporation shall be transferred or in which it shall be domesticated or continued      and the name of the resulting entity.   \n(4) That the transfer, domestication or continuance of the corporation has been approved in accordance with the provisions      of this section.   \n(5) In the case of a certificate of transfer, (i) that the existence of the corporation as a corporation of this State shall      cease when the certificate of transfer becomes effective, and (ii) the agreement of the corporation that it may be served      with process in this State in any proceeding for enforcement of any obligation of the corporation arising while it was a corporation      of this State which shall also irrevocably appoint the Secretary of State as its agent to accept service of process in any      such proceeding and specify the address to which a copy of such process shall be mailed by the Secretary of State. Process      may be served upon the Secretary of State under this subsection by means of electronic transmission but only as prescribed      by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is authorized to issue such rules and regulations with respect to such service      as the Secretary of State deems necessary or appropriate. In the event of service upon the Secretary of State in accordance      with this subsection, the Secretary of State shall forthwith notify such corporation that has transferred out of the State      of Delaware by letter, directed to such corporation that has transferred out of the State of Delaware at the address so specified,      unless such corporation shall have designated in writing to the Secretary of State a different address for such purpose, in      which case it shall be mailed to the last address designated. Such letter shall be sent by a mail or courier service that      includes a record of mailing or deposit with the courier and a record of delivery evidenced by the signature of the recipient.      Such letter shall enclose a copy of the process and any other papers served on the Secretary of State pursuant to this subsection.      It shall be the duty of the plaintiff in the event of such service to serve process and any other papers in duplicate, to      notify the Secretary of State that service is being effected pursuant to this subsection and to pay the Secretary of State      the sum of $50 for the use of the State, which sum shall be taxed as part of the costs in the proceeding, if the plaintiff      shall prevail therein. The Secretary of State shall maintain an alphabetical record of any such service setting forth the      name of the plaintiff and the defendant, the title, docket number and nature of the proceeding in which process has been served,      the fact that service has been effected pursuant to this subsection, the return date thereof, and the day and hour service      was made. The Secretary of State shall not be required to retain such information longer than 5 years from receipt of the      service of process.   \n(6) In the case of a certificate of transfer and domestic continuance, that the corporation will continue to exist as a corporation      of this State after the certificate of transfer and domestic continuance becomes effective.   \n(c) Upon the filing of a certificate of transfer in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and payment to the Secretary      of State of all fees prescribed under this title, the Secretary of State shall certify that the corporation has filed all      documents and paid all fees required by this title, and thereupon the corporation shall cease to exist as a corporation of      this State at the time the certificate of transfer becomes effective in accordance with § 103 of this title. Such certificate      of the Secretary of State shall be prima facie evidence of the transfer, domestication or continuance by such corporation      out of this State.   \n(d) The transfer, domestication or continuance of a corporation out of this State in accordance with this section and the      resulting cessation of its existence as a corporation of this State pursuant to a certificate of transfer shall not be deemed      to affect any obligations or liabilities of the corporation incurred prior to such transfer, domestication or continuance,      the personal liability of any person incurred prior to such transfer, domestication or continuance, or the choice of law applicable      to the corporation with respect to matters arising prior to such transfer, domestication or continuance. Unless otherwise      agreed or otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, the transfer, domestication or continuance of a corporation      out of the State of Delaware in accordance with this section shall not require such corporation to wind up its affairs or      pay its liabilities and distribute its assets under this title and shall not be deemed to constitute a dissolution of such      corporation.   \n(e) If a corporation files a certificate of transfer and domestic continuance, after the time the certificate of transfer      and domestic continuance becomes effective, the corporation shall continue to exist as a corporation of this State, and the      law of the State of Delaware, including this title, shall apply to the corporation to the same extent as prior to such time.      So long as a corporation continues to exist as a corporation of the State of Delaware following the filing of a certificate      of transfer and domestic continuance, the continuing corporation and the resulting entity shall, for all purposes of the laws      of the State of Delaware, constitute a single entity formed, incorporated, created or otherwise having come into being, as      applicable, and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and the laws of the foreign jurisdiction.   \n(f) When a corporation has transferred, domesticated or continued pursuant to this section, for all purposes of the laws of      the State of Delaware, the resulting entity shall be deemed to be the same entity as the transferring, domesticating or continuing      corporation and shall constitute a continuation of the existence of such corporation in the form of the resulting entity.      When any transfer, domestication or continuance shall have become effective under this section, for all purposes of the laws      of the State of Delaware, all of the rights, privileges and powers of the corporation that has transferred, domesticated or      continued, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to such corporation, as well as all other things      and causes of action belonging to such corporation, shall remain vested in the resulting entity (and also in the corporation      that has transferred, domesticated or continued, if and for so long as such corporation continues its existence as a corporation      of this State) and shall be the property of such resulting entity (and also of the corporation that has transferred, domesticated      or continued, if and for so long as such corporation continues its existence as a corporation of this State), and the title      to any real property vested by deed or otherwise in such corporation shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason      of this title; but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of such corporation shall be preserved unimpaired,      and all debts, liabilities and duties of such corporation shall remain attached to the resulting entity (and also to the corporation      that has transferred, domesticated or continued, if and for so long as such corporation continues its existence as a corporation      of this State), and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had originally      been incurred or contracted by it in its capacity as such resulting entity. The rights, privileges, powers and interests in      property of the corporation, as well as the debts, liabilities and duties of the corporation, shall not be deemed, as a consequence      of the transfer, domestication or continuance, to have been transferred to the resulting entity for any purpose of the laws      of the State of Delaware.   \n(g) In connection with a transfer, domestication or continuance under this section, shares of stock of the transferring, domesticating      or continuing corporation may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, or shares of stock, rights or securities      of, or interests in, the resulting entity or, in addition to or in lieu thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash,      property, or shares of stock, rights or securities of, or interests in, another corporation or other entity or may be cancelled.   \n(h) No vote of the stockholders of a corporation shall be necessary to authorize a transfer, domestication or continuance      if no shares of the stock of such corporation shall have been issued prior to the adoption by the board of directors of the      resolution approving the transfer, domestication or continuance.   \n(i) Whenever it shall be desired to transfer to or domesticate or continue in any foreign jurisdiction any nonstock corporation,      the governing body shall perform all the acts necessary to effect a transfer, domestication or continuance which are required      by this section to be performed by the board of directors of a corporation having capital stock. If the members of a nonstock      corporation are entitled to vote for the election of members of its governing body or are entitled under the certificate of      incorporation or the bylaws of such corporation to vote on such transfer, domestication or continuance or on a merger, consolidation,      or dissolution of the corporation, they, and any other holder of any membership interest in the corporation, shall perform      all the acts necessary to effect a transfer, domestication or continuance which are required by this section to be performed      by the stockholders of a corporation having capital stock. If there is no member entitled to vote thereon, nor any other holder      of any membership interest in the corporation, the transfer, domestication or continuance of the corporation shall be authorized      at a meeting of the governing body, upon the adoption of a resolution to transfer or domesticate or continue by the vote of      a majority of members of its governing body then in office. In all other respects, the method and proceedings for the transfer,      domestication or continuance of a nonstock corporation shall conform as nearly as may be to the proceedings prescribed by      this section for the transfer, domestication or continuance of corporations having capital stock. In the case of a charitable      nonstock corporation, due notice of the corporation's intent to effect a transfer, domestication or continuance shall be mailed      to the Attorney General of the State of Delaware 10 days prior to the date of the proposed transfer, domestication or continuance.

number.   \n(2) For the purpose of computing the taxes prescribed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, a certificate of amendment      of certificate of incorporation, or an amended certificate of incorporation before payment of capital, or a restated certificate      of incorporation, shall be considered as increasing the authorized capital stock of a corporation provided it involves an      increase in the number of shares, or an increase in the par value of shares, or a change of shares with par value into shares      without par value, or a change of shares without par value into shares with par value, or any combination of 2 or more of      the above changes, and provided further that the tax computed at the rates set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section upon      the total authorized capital stock of the corporation including the proposed change or changes exceeds the tax so computed      upon the total authorized stock of the corporation excluding such change or changes.   \n(c) The Secretary of State may issue photocopies or electronic image copies of instruments on file, as well as instruments,      documents and other papers not on file, and for

The Secretary of      State may also issue microfiche copies of instruments on file as well as instruments, documents and other papers not on file,      and for each such microfiche a fee of $2.00 shall be paid therefor. Notwithstanding Delaware's Freedom of Information Act      [Chapter 100 of Title 29] or other provision of this Code granting access to public records, the Secretary of State shall      issue only photocopies, microfiche or electronic image copies of records in exchange for the fees described above.   \n(d) No fees for the use of the State shall be charged or collected from any corporation incorporated for the drainage and      reclamation of lowlands or for the amendment or renewal of the charter of such corporation.   \n(e) The Secretary of State may in the Secretary of State's discretion permit the extension of credit for the taxes or fees      required by this section upon such terms as the Secretary of State shall deem to be appropriate.   \n(f) The Secretary of State shall retain from the revenue collected from the taxes or fees required by this section a sum sufficient      to provide at all times a fund of at least $500, but not more than $1,500, from which the Secretary of State may refund any      payment made pursuant to this section to the extent that it exceeds the taxes or fees required by this section. The fund shall      be deposited in the financial institution which is the legal depository of state moneys to the credit of the Secretary of      State and shall be disbursable on order of the Secretary of State.   \n(g) The Secretary of State may in the Secretary of State's discretion charge a fee of $60 for each check received for payment      of any fee or tax under Chapter 1 or Chapter 6 of this title that is returned due to insufficient funds or as the result of      a stop payment order.   \n(h) In addition to those fees charged under subsections (a) and (c) of this section, there shall be collected by and paid      to the Secretary of State the following:   \n(1) For all services described in subsection (a) of this section that are requested to be completed within 30 minutes on the      same day as the day of the request, an additional sum of up to $7,500 and for all services described in subsections (a) and      (c) of this section that are requested to be completed within 1 hour on the same day as the day of the request, an additional      sum of up to $1,000 and for all services described in subsections (a) and (c) of this section that are requested to be completed      within 2 hours on the same day as the day of the request, an additional sum of up to $500; and   \n(2) For all services described in subsections (a) and (c) of this section that are requested to be completed within the same      day as the day of the request, an additional sum of up to $300; and   \n(3) For all services described in subsections (a) and (c) of this section that are requested to be completed within a 24-hour      period from the time of the request, an additional sum of up to $150.   \nThe Secretary of State shall establish (and may from time to time alter or amend) a schedule of specific fees payable pursuant      to this subsection.   \n(i) A domestic corporation or a foreign corporation registered to do business in this State that files with the Secretary      of State any instrument or certificate, and in connection therewith, neglects, refuses or fails to pay any fee or tax under      Chapter 1 or Chapter 6 of this title shall, after written demand therefor by the Secretary of State by mail addressed to such      domestic corporation or foreign corporation in care of its registered agent in this State, cease to be in good standing as      a domestic corporation or registered as a foreign corporation in this State on the ninetieth day following the date of mailing      of such demand, unless such fee or tax and, if applicable, the fee provided for in subsection (g) of this section are paid      in full prior to the ninetieth day following the date of mailing of such demand. A domestic corporation that has ceased to      be in good standing or a foreign corporation that has ceased to be registered by reason of the neglect, refusal or failure      to pay any such fee or tax shall be restored to and have the status of a domestic corporation in good standing or a foreign      corporation that is registered in this State upon the payment of the fee or tax which such domestic corporation or foreign      corporation neglected, refused or failed to pay together with the fee provided for in subsection (g) of this section, if applicable.      The Secretary of State shall not accept for filing any instrument authorized to be filed with the Secretary of State under      this title in respect of any domestic corporation that is not in good standing or any foreign corporation that has ceased      to be registered by reason of the neglect, refusal or failure to pay any such fee or tax, and shall not issue any certificate      of good standing with respect to such domestic corporation or foreign corporation, unless and until such domestic corporation      or foreign corporation shall have been restored to and have the status of a domestic corporation in good standing or a foreign      corporation duly registered in this State.   \n(j) As used in this section, the term \"exempt corporation\" shall have the meaning given to it in § 501(b) of this title.
